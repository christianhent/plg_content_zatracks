# plg_content_zatracks

This Joomla content plugin extends the capabilities of the articles component by adding **support for import and display of GPX** data inside your articles. If you've always wondered how to show tracked activities like cycling or running workouts on your Joomla! based website, now you have a tiny but smart solution.

It uploads &amp; processes GPX files, calculates durations, distances, elevation stats &amp; average speeds and encodes polylines. 

Trackpoints are stored as geoJSON.

For showing and interacting with maps, the open-source JavaScript library Leaflet is used.

## Notice
